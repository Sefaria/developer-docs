# A Topics Treemap

In this tutorial, we're going to using the [Topics API](https://developers.sefaria.org/reference/get-all-topics) to build a basic data visualization using [D3Plus](https://d3plus.org/?path=/docs/introduction--d3plus).

You can see the entire repository [here](https://github.com/Sefaria/dataviz-tutorial).

## Tutorial Setup

For this tutorial, we'll be using [React](https://react.dev/).

### 1. Creating the App

First, ensure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. We'll be using [Vite](https://vite.dev/) to create the basic template for the React app. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Run `npx create-vite@latest <name-of-app> --template react`
2. Then, `cd <name-of-app>`
3. Install your dependencies via `npm install`
4. Run the app via `npm run dev`

You should see something running at http://localhost:5173/.

### 2. Install D3Plus for React

This tutorial use the [D3Plus](https://d3plus.org/?path=/docs/introduction--d3plus) library to generate a data visualization. In order to get the required D3Plus packages,  run `npm install d3plus-text` and `npm install d3plus-react`.

### 3. Writing code in App.jsx

This tutorial will focus _only_ on the code we wrote in `App.jsx`, the main body of the application. We made some other tweaks for styling and streamlining purposes in addition to the code described here. In order to see those, visit the full GitHub repository containing this project [here](https://github.com/Sefaria/dataviz-tutorial). The [README](https://github.com/Sefaria/dataviz-tutorial/blob/main/README.md) also includes notes for running the project locally.

This tutorial will review the file line by line. In order to see everything together check out the [repo](https://github.com/Sefaria/dataviz-tutorial) or scroll to the bottom of this page.

# Building the Visualization

Seeing as Vite provides templated content for `App.jsx`, the first step is to delete the entire contents of the provided file. The default content will be replaced with the code below.

## Imports

At the top of your file, add the necessary imports. We need the [useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) and [useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState), two [React hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks), and the [Treemap](https://d3plus.org/?path=/docs/charts-treemap--d3plus) visualization from D3Plus.

```javascript
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import {Treemap} from "d3plus-react";
```

> 🚧 Component Structure
>
> For the sake of simplicity and for the flow of a tutorial (where text is interwoven with code) we chose to keep everything together, as one big component. It would be better, however, if each aspect of the page was created as its own component and rendered inside of the `<App />` component.

## useState() Hooks

The following description assumes basic knowledge of React and React hooks. If you're new to these, feel free to check out the linked documentation above to learn more before continuing with the tutorial.

Start by setting up the top of your component with your state hooks.

```javascript
const [data, setData] = useState([]);
const [limit, setLimit] = useState(100);
const [includePeopleTopics, setIncludePeopleTopics] = useState(false);
```

As you continue, you will need to track three things:

1. The `data` from the API
2. The `limit`: This is a query parameter for the API describing how many topics we want returned from the query.
3. A boolean `includePeopleTopics`: Seeing as some topics with a subclass of `person` have an overwhelming amount of sources linked to them, this offers users the ability to toggle between displaying those topics or not as part of the treemap.

## API Call and Data Processing

### The Topics API

At a high level,  the [Topics API](https://developers.sefaria.org/reference/get-all-topics) returns a list of [topics from the Sefaria Library](https://www.sefaria.org.il/topics). Below is a JSON focusing on a single topic, serving as a way of understanding the data we have to work with.

```json
[
  {
    "slug": "rabbi-yochanan-b-napacha",
    "titles": [...], // Commented out for brevity
    "subclass": "person",
    "alt_ids": {...}, // Commented out for brevity
    "properties": {...}, // Commented out for brevity
    "description": {
      "en": "R. Yochanan studied under R. Yehudah haNasi and emerged as the next leader after his death. He directed the academy in Tiberias and set up the groundwork for the Jerusalem Talmud. His unusual beauty, sharpness and personal sufferings made him a captivating yet intimidating teacher. It was due to his personality and his unrivaled learning that the center of Torah study did not move to Babylonia during his lifetime.",
      "he": "רבי יוחנן למד עם רבי יהודה הנשיא והיה למנהיג הבא אחרי מותו. עמד בראש הסנהדרין בטבריה והכין את היסודות לתלמוד הירושלמי. יופיו החריג, חריפותו וסבלו האישי עשו אותו למורה שובה אך מאיים. בשל אישיותו ותלמודו המעולה, לא עבר מרכז לימוד התורה לבבל במשך חייו."
    },
    "categoryDescription": {},
    "numSources": 24590,
    "description_published": true,
    "primaryTitle": {
      "en": "Rabbi Yochanan b. Napacha",
      "he": "רבי יוחנן"
    }
  }
]
```

For this use case, the most important data are the primary English title of the topic (or the `numSources` field) which indicates the number of Sefaria Library sources linked to the topic and the `subclass`, which will be crucial for allowing users the option to view non-people topics only.

With this information at hand, we can return to the code.

### UseEffect

This section of the tutorial includes three steps:

1. Inside of our `useEffect` hook, we make a call to the [Topics API](https://developers.sefaria.org/reference/get-all-topics). If `includePeopleTopics` is `false`, we filter out any topic with a subclass of `person`. Otherwise, the people topics will remain present in the returned data.
2. After making a call, we use a `map` function to create an array of objects with the field `title` and `numSources`. 
3. Finally, we use our `setData` hook to set this filtered and mapped data in our `data` state.

```javascript
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`https://www.sefaria.org/api/topics?limit=${limit}`)
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((res) => {
        if (res) {
          const filteredData = res
          .filter((topic) => includePeopleTopics || !(topic.subclass && topic.subclass === "person"))
          .map((topic) => ({
            title: topic.primaryTitle?.en, 
            numSources: topic.numSources
          }));
  
          setData(filteredData);
        }
      })
      .catch((err) => console.error(err));
  }, [limit, includePeopleTopics]);
```

This `useEffect` is set to re-render any time there's a change in `limit` or `includePeopleTopics`, two values we allow the users to toggle in the controls.

## Returning JSX

Once we have all that set up, it's time to return our JSX! After setting up some controls for the user we can render the visualization. As noted above, these would ideally be separated into sub-components but, for the sake of the tutorial, have been kept together.

### The User Controls

Inside our user controls is a range toggle that allows users to set the `limit` on the number of topics they'd like returned from the API. On change, we call our `setLimit` hook and change the limit to the value targeted by the user. Recall, any change to `limit` triggers `useEffect` to run, querying the API again and refreshing the data.

```javascript React
<h1>Sefaria Topics Data-Viz</h1>
	<div className="controls">
		<h4 className="centered">Controls</h4>
			<div>
				<span>Adjust the number of topics queried from the API: </span>
					<input
              type="range"
              min="100"
              max="5000"
              value={limit}
              step="100"
              onChange={(e) => setLimit(Number(e.target.value))}
            />
         <span>{limit}</span>
        </div>
```

Afterwards, we also create a checkbox for users to toggle in order to indicate whether they would like the "people" topics to be included in the display or not:

```Text React
        <div>
          <label>
            <input
              type="checkbox"
              checked={includePeopleTopics}
              onChange={() => setIncludePeopleTopics(!includePeopleTopics)}
             />
            Include People Topics
           </label>
        </div>   
```

On any check (or un-checking) the callback function calls our `setIncludePeopleTopics` hook to `true` or `false`.  (Recall, any change to `limit` triggers `useEffect` to run, refreshing the data by re-running it through the conditional filtering).

### The Visualization

Beneath the controls, we render the visualization. The nice thing about D3Plus is that instead of diving into the nitty gritty of D3 configuration, we get an out-of-the-box React component. All we need to do is pass in our data, and set the config the way we'd like it. Let's take a look:

```Text React
<Treemap config={{
			data: data,
      groupBy: "title",
      sum: "numSources", 
      height: 400,
      width: 1200,
      shapeConfig: {
      	label: d => {
                return [d.title];
              },
       },
       tooltipConfig: {
              tbody: (d) => [
                ["Linked Sources:", d.numSources]
              ]
      },
}} />
```

The `<Treemap/>` component takes one prop, `config`, where we can pass the data and set the configurations. You'll see we pass in the data, ask to group the topics by their `title`, and create the area value on the map based on the `sum` of the `numSources`.

The next few lines arrange the desired height and width of the visualization, as well as overriding some defaults to make things clean and presentable. (`shapeConfig` allows us to hide percentage values, which make less sense in this case... and `tooltipConfig` does the same, just in the context of the hover-able tooltip).

  ### Congratulations!

  You've officially built your first data visualization using data from the Sefaria API!
</Callout>

# Further Expansion

Obviously, this example is extremely bare-bones and just meant as a proof of concept. Can you take this example and expand?

Some possibilities:

* Experimenting with the use of different visualizations
* Experimenting with a different visualization library
* Experimenting with different API endpoints, what's most the most useful visualization you can make based on the Jewish canon?

If you build something, [let us know](https://developers.sefaria.org/page/contact-us)! We love seeing all of the projects [powered by our data](https://developers.sefaria.org/docs/powered-by-sefaria)!
