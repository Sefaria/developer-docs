## Creating a New Category

If you decide to get Sefaria up and running locally, you can play around with creating new categories on your own clone of the site. 

In Python: 

```
import django

django.setup()

from sefaria.model import *

c = Category()
c.add_primary_titles("New Category", u"חדשנית")
c.path = ["Existing Parent", "New Category"] # Where "Existing Parent" is an existing parent, such as "Tanakh"
c.save()
```

### POST Request

POST requests need a full valid category object in the `json` attribute of the POST body.  Note that the parent of the category must already exist.  When creating more than one category, the ancestors must be created in order.  

Send a POST request to `/api/category` with a complete serialized category record in the `json` attribute of the POST body.

**Sample `body` of a POST Request to Create a New Category**

```
{
  "apikey": "your_local_api_key", 
	{
  	"path": ["Tanakh", "New Category"],
 		"titles": [
    						{
      	          "lang": "en", 
        	        "primary": "True", 
          	      "text": "New Category"},
  							{
              	  "lang": "he", 
                	"primary": "True", 
                	"text": "חדשנית"}
  						]
	}
}
```

**Note:** When an Index record is posted, the category that it is in must exist.  If the category does not exist, then the Index save will fail with a `InputError` Exception, and an Index post will return a JSON object with an `error` as its only key.

For more on the Category object, see the object [definition](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/blob/fe9c971217b99cd763c0dd8f42b82339379b961c/sefaria/model/category.py#L14) in `Sefaria-Project/sefaria/model/Category.py`.
