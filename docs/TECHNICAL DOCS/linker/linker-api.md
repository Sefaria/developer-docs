The [Sefaria Linker](https://www.sefaria.org/linker) relies on a POST API, documented below.

# Introduction

Takes in text input and returns the location, as well as a Sefaria link for each citation in the text. 

:warning: NOTE: The response format has changed recently. See [Response Format](#response-format) below.

Below is a table detailing current support by language.

| Language | Support                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| English  | Relies on convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Aim is to limit false positives. Supports ibid citations. Will return multiple options if a citation is ambiguous.                                           |
| Hebrew   | Relies on a BERT-based transformer model. Aim is to limit false positives. Supports ibid citations. Will return multiple options if a citation is ambiguous. Performance should be better than the English model. |

# API

## POST /api/find-refs

This endpoint takes text as input and returns the location as well as a Sefaria link for each citation.

### URL parameters

| URL param    | Description                                                                                                                                            | Type                   | Default |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------- |
| with_text    | Return the text for each citation. See [with_text format section](#with_text-format) for details.                                                      | 0 or 1                 | 0       |
| debug        | Return debug information for each citation. See [debug format section](#debug-format) for details.                                                     | 0 or 1                 | 0       |
| max_segments | When `with_text` is `1`, what is the max number of segments to return for a citation. Limits size of response for general citations like `פרשת בראשית` | int. 0 means no limit. | 0       |

### POST body

POST body should be a serialized JSON with the following fields

| Field | Description                                                                           | Required |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| text  | Text to search for citations in. See [text format section](#text-format) for details. | Yes      |

### Response format

Responds with HTTP code 202 (indicating the request was accepted but not yet completed) and a task ID in the following format

```javascript
{
  "task_id": <str>
}
```

This task ID can then be used to poll the async API until a 200 response code is received. When the async API returns a 200, the response will contain a `"result"` key with the following object. See [example](#example).

```javascript
{
   "title": {
      // data corresponding to results in the "title" field of the POST data
      "results": [
         "startChar": <int>,    // start character of result relative to input text.
         "endChar": <int>,      // end character of result relative to input text.
         "text": <str>,         // text of the citation for this result. corresponds to data.title.substring(startChar, endChar)
         "linkFailed": <bool>,  // true if reference was located but failed to be linked to a source on Sefaria. Could mean an error in the linker or the source doesn't exist on Sefaria.
         "refs": [<str>],       // list of references in Sefaria format that this result could be linked to. If more than one reference, then the citation was considered to be ambiguous.
      ],
      "refData": {
         // object with keys for every ref in "results".
         <ref>: {
            heRef: <str>,           // Hebrew translation of reference
            url: <str>,             // reference in URL form. Create a URL to Sefaria with this format: www.sefaria.org/<url>
            primaryCategory: <str>  // primary category of reference in Sefaria. Corresponds to location in table of contents ([sefaria.org/texts](sefaria.org/texts).
            he: <str>,              // Hebrew text of <ref>. Only included if `with_text` URL param is `1`.
            en: <str>,              // English text of <ref>. Only included if `with_text` URL param is `1`.
            isTruncated: <bool>     // Was text truncated. Only included if `with_text` URL param is `1` and `max_segments` URL param is greater than 0.
         }
      },  
      "debugData": [],  // array of debug data where each element corresponds to an element in "results". only included if "debug" URL param is `1`. see "debug format" section.
   },
   "body": {
       // data corresponding to results in the "body" field of the POST data
       // same format as "title" object
   }
}
```

### with_text format

When `with_text` URL param is `1`, the following keys are added to the response object at `response.title.refData` and `response.body.refData`.

| Field       | Description                                                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| he          | Hebrew text of `<ref>` where `<ref>` is the key of the `refData` element.  |
| en          | English text of `<ref>` where `<ref>` is the key of the `refData` element. |
| isTruncated | Was text truncated according to `max_segments` URL param.                  |

### debug format

When the `debug` URL param is `1`, the `debugData` field is added to the response object at `response.title` and `response.body`. The `debugData` field has the same shape as `response.title.results` and `response.body.results` (a 2-D array where the outer array is for each citation found and inner arrays are for each possible way of parsing a given citation). Below is an example of a single element in `debugData` with comments explaining each field:

```javascript
 {
               "orig_part_strs":[  // original input string broken into parts
                  "איוב",
                  "פרק יז"
               ],
               "orig_part_types":[  // associated types for each part in `orig_part_strs`
                  "NAMED",
                  "NUMBERED"
               ],
               "final_part_strs":[  // final part strings after processing (often times this is the same as `orig_part_strs` but can differ if in some cases)
                  "איוב",
                  "פרק יז"
               ],
               "final_part_types":[  // associated types for each part in `final_part_strs`
                  "NAMED",
                  "NUMBERED"
               ],
               "resolved_part_strs":[  // actual parts that were resolved. This is important because sometimes the parts are merged during resolution
                  "איוב",
                  "פרק יז"
               ],
               "resolved_part_types":[  // associated types for each part in `resolved_part_strs`
                  "NAMED",
                  "NUMBERED"
               ],
               "resolved_part_classes":[  // associated classes for each part in `resolved_part_strs`. This can help debug cases where context and ibid were used.
                  "RawRefPart",
                  "RawRefPart"
               ],
               "context_ref":null,  // If a context ref was used to resolve the citation (e.g. in the case of an ibid citation), it will appear here.
               "context_type":null  // associated type of context for `context_ref`.
            }
```

### text format

The POST data field `text` should be formatted as follows:

```javascript
{
   "title": <str>,  // text of the title of the document. May be empty string when there is not title. Any citations found in the title will be assumed as context for citations found in the "body". This is useful for articles that focus on one Perek of Tanakh for example.
   "body": <str>  // text of the body of the document
}
```

# Example

Below is an example in cURL which uses all the URL parameters. Note, none of the URL parameters are required. The example shows how a citation found in the "title" field can be used as context for citations in the "body" field.

## Input

```curl
curl -X POST 'https://www.sefaria.org/api/find-refs?debug=1&with_text=1&max_segments=5' --data-raw '{"text":{"body": "ראה מה שכתוב בפסוק א.", "title": "עיון על איוב פרק יז"}}'
```

## Output

The API call above will return a task ID such as the following:

```javascript
{ "task_id": "my-task-id" }
```

Poll the async API until you get a 200 response code.

```curl
curl -X GET 'https://www.sefaria.org/api/async/my-task-id
```

 When the async API does return a 200 response code, you will see the following response. Note, the linker API response data is in the `"result"`field.

```javascript
{
  "task_id": "my-task-id",
  "state": "SUCCESS",
  "ready": true,
  "result": {
    "title": {
      "results": [
        {

# Debug using local webpage

In order to easily debug why certain citations aren't working, it is useful to use the linker.js plugin, as it has certain debug tools built in. Below is a skeleton HTML page that can be used to test content against the linker. This webpage has linker.js embedded in debug mode, which will show all citations caught, including ones that weren't linked. See [here](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/wiki/Sefaria-Auto-Linker-v3#debug) for more information on how the `debug` option works.

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>TITLE HERE</h1>
        <p>BODY HERE</p>
    </body>
    <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="https://www.sefaria.org/linker.v3.js"></script>
    <script>sefaria.link({debug: true});</script>
</html>
```
