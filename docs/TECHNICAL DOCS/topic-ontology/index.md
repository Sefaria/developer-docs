To learn more about Topics on Sefaria, see the [Topics API](ref:get_api-topics-topic-slug).

Sefaria's Topics collection is organized as an ontology based on [BFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Formal_Ontology). Below is a basic overview of BFO's structure, followed by some of the more important nodes Sefaria has added. The `slug` is the unique ID used in our database.

# An Overview of BFO

The BFO, or Basic Formal Ontology, is a foundational ontology that provides a set of fundamental terms and relationships for describing the structure of reality. BFO aims to provide a common framework for describing entities and their relationships that is independent of any specific domain. Sefaria has built upon this to create an ontology for Topics on Sefaria.

_For a complete documentation of BFO, see [here](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO#implementations)._

## Slugs and Nodes

The following table includes information about the various nodes and their meanings.

| `slug`                                      | Name                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Parents                             |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `entity`                                    | Entity                                    | This is a root node                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | N/A                                 |
| `continuant`                                | Continuant                                | Can only be sliced in space and not in time. This entity continues to exist through time while maintaining its identity.                                                                                                                         | `entity`                            |
| `occurent`                                  | Occurent                                  | This is where continuants get applied or executed. It can be sliced in time.                                                                                                                                                                     | `entity`                            |
| `independent-continuant`                    | Independent Continuant                    | This continuant exists independent of any other entity. Examples include people, planets, and ping pong balls.                                                                                                                                   | `continuant`                        |
| `specifically-dependent-continuant`         | Specifically Dependent Continuant         | This is a continuant whose existence is dependent on another entity, also described as a quality. For example, you can't have a headache without a head. Therefore, the headache is specifically dependent.                                      | `continuant`                        |
| `generically-dependent-continuant`          | Generically Dependent Continuant          | This is a continuant whose existence is not dependent on a specific entity but on another entity in a more general way. Examples include a PDF file or a law.                                                                                    | `continuant`                        |
| `acts`                                      | Process                                   | This is always 1D. It is an act that takes time to complete.                                                                                                                                                                                     | `occurent`                          |
| `process-boundary`                          | Process Boundary                          | This is the boundary of a process: the beginning, end, or other threshold. By definition, this occupies a 0D temporal region.                                                                                                                    | `occurent`                          |
| `time`                                      | Time                                      | This is a temporal region, an occurrent entity that is part of time, as defined in relation to a reference frame.                                                                                                                                | `occurent`                          |

# Overview of Sefaria Link Types

Below is a comprehensive list of link types that can exist between nodes in the Sefaria infrastructure. Please note:

* Every Topic link in our database must be one of these types. 
* Every link is bidirectional. Therefore, if you're reading the link in the forward direction, you should use `slug`, but if you're reading it in the backward direction, use `inverseSlug`. 

Below is an example of a bidirectional Topic link:

```
{
    "fromTopic": "isaac",
    "toTopic": "abraham",
    "linkType": "child-of"
}
```

In the forward direction, this link would be read as `isaac` -`child-of`-> `abraham`. In the backward direction, however, this link would be read as `abraham`-`parent-of`-> `isaac`. All links in our database are saved using the link type's `slug`, not the `inverseSlug`.

Links with the same `slug` and `inverseSlug` are symmetrical. As yet, we have not inferred Topic links from existing links (e.g., if we know "a" is a child of "b", and "c" is a sibling of "a", then "c" is a child of "b").

## Link Types Between People

The following are link types that connect two individual people.

| `slug`              | `inverseSlug`       | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `child-of`          | `parent-of`         |                                                                                                                                  |
| `child-in-law-of`   | `parent-in-law-of`  |                                                                                                                                  |
| `sibling-of`        | `sibling-of`        |                                                                                                                                  |
| `descendant-of`     | `ancestor-of`       | Used for relating a descendant to their ancestor, e.g., David -`descendant-of` -> Ruth                                           |
| `taught`            | `learned-from`      | Usually used for connecting a rabbi and a student                                                                                |
| `corresponded-with` | `corresponded-with` | Used to connect two people who have communicated with one another, and whose relationship does not fit under another link type.  |
| `opposed`           | `opposed`           | Used to connect two people whose views are in opposition to one another.                                                         |
| `cousin-of`         | `cousin-of`         |                                                                                                                                  |
| `spouse-of`         | `spouse-of`         |                                                                                                                                  |

## Link Types Between Other Types of Nodes

Each link type is only valid if the `fromTopic` is of type `Valid From` _and_ if the `toTopic` is of the type `Valid To`.

| `slug`                         | `inverseSlug`                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Valid From                                                                | Valid To                 |

## General Link Types

The following link types can connect any two nodes:

| `slug`              | `inverseSlug`           | Description                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `is-a`              | `is-category-of`        | Describes ontological hierarchy between nodes. A - `is-a` -> B implies that B is a more general type of A             |
| `displays-under`    | `displays-above`        | Describes display structure of nodes. This is used to display the table of contents for topics on Sefaria's frontend. |
| `synonymous-with`   | `synonymous-with`       | Two topics which are almost always interchangeable. e.g. `totafot` is -`synonymous-with`-> teffilin                   |
| `similar-to`        | `similar-to`            | Two topics which are similar in many of their attributes. e.g. `saving` is -`similar-to`-> `rescuing`                 |
| `dissimilar-to`     | `dissimilar-to`         | Two topics which are not similar in many of their attributes. e.g. `work` is -`dissimilar-to`-> `rest`                |
| `related-to`        | `related-to`            | Two topics which are generally related. Usually these two topics' relationship doesn't fit under any other link type  |
| `sheets-related-to` | `has-sheets-related-to` | Two topics whose relationship was derived from colocation of tags on source sheets                                    |
